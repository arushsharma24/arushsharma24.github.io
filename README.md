Hi. I am Arush Sharma, a Software Engineer at Cisco, and a tech enthusiast who loves to try out new things and technologies.

Progress tracker for this website:
 - [X] Add blogs support (basic)
 - [ ] Add date and time to blogs, and filtering and sorting in the display
 - [ ] Change color theming
 - [ ] Add fun projects to projects page

Notes:
 - The deployment on github pages will only be updated if the out/ directory with the latest build artifacts has also been uploaded to github
